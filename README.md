# Cubo  
Cubo is a simple HTTP server application built in Swift, using NIO's implementation of HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.

## Etymology  
Cubo is named after the NeXTcube computer, sold by NeXT Computers during the early 90's. This same model was used by Tim Berners-Lee to create the first web server software ever, the CERN httpd, and it was also used as the first web server of the entire WWW.

## Usage  
Launching Cubo's web server is as simple as typing:  
```sh
cubo
```  
This is equivalent to running:  
```sh
cubo --port 8080 --source .
```  

## Help  
If you need more information or have missed something, you can run:  
```sh
cubo --help
```  
This will provide all possible flags and options.

## License  
Cubo is released under the GNU GPLv3 license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more information.
